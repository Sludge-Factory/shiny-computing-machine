<p>Hello, this is a design page. Since it is very <strong>basic</strong> and very <em>small</em>, the page's code can be easily interpreted. Please go ahead and view the page's code now.</p>

<h2>Basics of HTML</h2>
<p>This is the section where you will learn the basics of this language. The language of HTML is broken down into small sections such as <strong>Headers </strong><em>(h1, h2, h3, etc)</em>, <strong>Paragraphs </strong><em>(p)</em>, and <strong>Dividers </strong><em>(div)</em>. These units each serve a particular function and the compiler within browsers that the code runs through automatically use these units to format your code into webpages.
</p>
  
  <p>
    Text inside objects such as Paragraphs can be manipulated to appear differently when the code is run. Here is an example:
  </p>
  <p><font face="courier new" color="orange" size="5">This text is orange and in a different font!
    <br>
    Also It's Huge!</font>
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Kind of cool, right?
    <br>
    Well, that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to design and customization of text using HTML.
